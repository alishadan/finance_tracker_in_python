Knowing how much you earn and how much you spend over a month (or any specific period) helps you understand your financial habits, improve your income, and control your expenses. While you could track everything in a notebook, that quickly becomes boring and impractical. A more enjoyable and efficient way is to record your transactions on a computer — and that’s exactly what finance_tracer is designed for. This program allows you to easily enter your income and expenses, categorize them, and save them for later review. To get started, simply download the application and run finance_tracer.exe.
